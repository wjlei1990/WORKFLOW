Overview
--------
  SAC (Seismic Analysis Code), previously SAC2000, is a general-purpose 
  interactive program designed for the study of sequential signals, 
  especially time-series data. Emphasis has been placed on analysis tools used 
  by research seismologists in the detailed study of seismic events. Analysis 
  capabilities include general arithmetic operations, Fourier transforms, three 
  spectral estimation techniques, IIR and FIR filtering, signal stacking, 
  decimation, interpolation, correlation, and seismic phase picking. SAC also 
  contains an extensive graphics capability. Binary versions are available for 
  Intel Mac and Linux, but SAC can be built from the source code for other
  computer operating systems.  The source code is written in C.  For further 
  details regarding requirements to build and run SAC, see the README file that
  comes with the distribution.

  SAC was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and is copyrighted 
  by the University of California.  It is currently begin developed and maintained 
  by a small group of developers  working in cooperation with IRIS 
  (http://www.iris.edu).

  Thr Using SAC part of the SAC Users Manual contains general information for the 
  new user about what SAC can do, how it works, and how to get started. It also 
  contains detailed information for the more experienced user on topics such as how
  to use SAC macros, how to read and write SAC data files from C or FORTRAN 
  programs, and how the SAC program is structured.

  The Users Manual will be periodically updated to include new descriptions and to 
  revise old ones. Please report any errors in this manual to the sac=help listserv:
  <sac-help@iris.washington.edu>.  Although the version of the manual that comes
  with the binay or source distribution will be updated only when a new version comes
  out, the online version of the manual at <http://www.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/>
  can be updated at any time.

Other Sections
--------------
  `Command Reference Manual`_ contains detailed descriptions of each SAC 
  command including purpose, syntax, default values, and examples. This manual 
  also contains lists of SAC commands sorted alphabetically and functionally.

  `Spectral-Estimation Subprocess Manual`_ describes a subprocess for the 
  study of stationary random processes. A subprocess is like a small separate 
  program within the main SAC program.

  `Signal-Stacking Subprocess Manual`_ describes a subprocess for performing 
  signal stacking with delays, traveltimes, and record section plots.

Notation
--------
  Repeating an important point made above, you may enter keywords and options in 
  either uppercase or lowercase. SAC converts these to uppercase before 
  interpreting them. The exceptions to this rule are text appearing within 
  single or double quotes and the names of directories and files. The case of 
  these items is not changed. They are interpreted literally.
